# Supabase to Appwrite Migration Progress

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### 1. Database Schema Setup
- [x] Created comprehensive Appwrite database schema with 11 collections
- [x] Added proper indexes for optimal query performance
- [x] Created storage buckets for file uploads
- [x] Automated schema creation with `npm run setup-appwrite` script

### 2. Data Migration
- [x] Migrated 39 technology skills across categories
- [x] Added 12 achievement badges
- [x] Created 6 sample projects with skill tags
- [x] Automated data migration with `npm run migrate-data` script

### 3. Core Infrastructure
- [x] Installed Appwrite SDK
- [x] Created Appwrite configuration (`src/lib/appwrite.ts`)
- [x] Updated database connection layer (`src/lib/database/connection.ts`)
- [x] Added comprehensive TypeScript types (`src/lib/database/appwrite-types.ts`)
- [x] Migrated BaseRepository to use Appwrite
- [x] Migrated SkillRepository and UserSkillRepository to use Appwrite
- [x] Updated authentication hook (`src/hooks/useAuth.ts`) to use Appwrite

## üîÑ Remaining Tasks

### 1. Repository Migration
- [ ] Update ProfileRepository to use Appwrite
- [ ] Update ProjectRepository to use Appwrite
- [ ] Update other repositories in `src/lib/database/repositories/`

### 2. Hook Updates
- [ ] Update `src/hooks/useSkills.ts` to work with new repositories
- [ ] Update `src/hooks/useProjects.ts` to work with new repositories
- [ ] Update `src/hooks/useMessages.ts` to work with new repositories
- [ ] Update `src/hooks/useDatabase.ts` to work with Appwrite

### 3. Component Updates
- [ ] Update components that make direct Supabase calls
- [ ] Test authentication flows in components
- [ ] Update error handling to work with Appwrite errors

### 4. Permissions Setup
- [x] **Scripted Permissions**: Defined and automated collection-level and initial document-level permissions in `setup-appwrite-schema.js` and relevant repositories/hooks.
    - Collection-level permissions set for all collections.
    - Document-level permissions for `profiles` (owner can update/delete) implemented in `useAuth.ts`.
    - `BaseRepository.ts` updated to support passing permissions on document creation.
- [ ] **Manual Review & Fine-tuning (Appwrite Console)**:
    - [ ] Review and confirm collection permissions in Appwrite Console.
    - [ ] Test and adjust document-level permissions for other collections as they are implemented (e.g., `projects`, `user_skills`).
    - [ ] Ensure comprehensive replacement of Supabase RLS policies.

### 5. Testing & Cleanup
- [ ] Test authentication (sign up, sign in, sign out)
- [ ] Test data operations (CRUD operations)
- [ ] Test skills and projects functionality
- [ ] Remove Supabase dependencies
- [ ] Clean up unused files

## üìã Current Status

**Database**: ‚úÖ Fully set up and populated
**Authentication**: ‚úÖ Migrated to Appwrite
**Base Repository**: ‚úÖ Migrated to Appwrite
**Skills Repository**: ‚úÖ Migrated to Appwrite
**User Skills Repository**: ‚úÖ Migrated to Appwrite

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Continue Repository Migration**: Update ProfileRepository and ProjectRepository
2. **Update Hooks**: Ensure all custom hooks work with the new repositories
3. **Test Authentication**: Verify sign up/sign in flows work
4. **Set Permissions**: Configure collection permissions in Appwrite Console
5. **Clean Up**: Remove Supabase dependencies once everything is working
